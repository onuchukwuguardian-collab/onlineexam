## üö® Security Warnings

1. **Never commit `.env` files** - Contains sensitive credentials
2. **Always use HTTPS in production** - Protects data in transit
3. **Regular security updates** - Keep Laravel and dependencies updated
4. **Monitor logs regularly** - Watch for suspicious activities
5. **Backup regularly** - Ensure data recovery capabilities

## üìû Security Incident Response

If you suspect a security breach:

3. Update all dependencies
4. Consider taking the application offline temporarily
5. Contact security professionals if needed

## üîç Regular Security Maintenance

- Weekly: Review security logs
- Monthly: Update dependencies
