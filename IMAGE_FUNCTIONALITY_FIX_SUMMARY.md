# Image Functionality Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. JavaScript Syntax Error
- **Problem**: Missing comma in fetch headers causing "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string"
- **Location**: Line ~1712 in `resources/views/admin/questions/index.blade.php`
- **Fix**: Added missing comma and proper headers structure:
```javascript
fetch(routes.deleteImage.replace(':id', questionId), {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData,
    headers: {  // Added missing 'headers:' and comma
        'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest',
        'X-CSRF-TOKEN': document.querySelector('meta[name="csrf-token"]').content
    }
})
```

### 2. Duplicate Function Definitions
- **Problem**: Functions `triggerImageUpload` and `openImageModal` were defined twice, causing conflicts
- **Location**: Lines 950-1023 in `resources/views/admin/questions/index.blade.php`
- **Fix**: Removed the first set of duplicate functions, keeping only the enhanced versions

### 3. Function Reference Errors
- **Problem**: "Uncaught ReferenceError: openImageModal is not defined" and "triggerImageUpload is not defined"
- **Cause**: Duplicate definitions and syntax errors preventing proper function loading
- **Fix**: Cleaned up duplicates and syntax errors
