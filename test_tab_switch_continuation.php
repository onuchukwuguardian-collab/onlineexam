echo "\n5. Expected Behavior:\n";
echo "\n   🔄 **Tab Switch and Return Process:**\n";
echo "   1. Student switches tabs during exam\n";
echo "   2. System detects violation and logs them out\n";
echo "   3. Violation is recorded in database\n";
echo "   4. Student logs back in\n";
echo "   5. ✅ Student can continue from SAME question\n";
echo "   6. ✅ All previous answers are PRESERVED\n";
echo "   7. ✅ Timer continues from where it left off\n";
echo "   8. ✅ Security warning banner is displayed\n";

echo "\n   ⏰ **Timer Behavior:**\n";
echo "   • Timer NEVER stops or pauses\n";
echo "   • Timer continues running during logout\n";
echo "   • If timer expires while logged out, exam auto-submits\n";
echo "   • Student can only continue if time remains\n";

echo "\n   ⚠️ **Warning System:**\n";
echo "   • First violation: Warning about continuation and timer\n";
echo "   • Second violation: Final warning about account lock\n";
echo "   • Third violation: Account locked message\n";
echo "   • All violations permanently recorded\n";

echo "\n6. Testing Instructions:\n";
echo "\n   **Test Continuation After Tab Switch:**\n";
echo "   1. Start exam as student\n";
echo "   2. Answer questions 1-3 (select specific answers)\n";
echo "   3. Navigate to question 5\n";
echo "   4. Switch to another tab (Ctrl+T)\n";
echo "   5. ✅ Should be logged out with critical warning\n";
echo "   6. Log back in immediately\n";
echo "   7. Start the same exam again\n";
echo "   8. ✅ Should see security warning banner\n";
echo "   9. ✅ Should be on question 5 (where you left off)\n";
echo "   10. ✅ Questions 1-3 should still have your answers\n";
echo "   11. ✅ Timer should show correct remaining time\n";

echo "\n   **Test Timer Expiration During Logout:**\n";
echo "   1. Start exam with very short timer (e.g., 2 minutes)\n";
echo "   2. Answer a few questions\n";
echo "   3. Switch tabs to get logged out\n";
echo "   4. Wait for timer to expire (don't log back in)\n";
echo "   5. Try to log back in after timer expires\n";
echo "   6. ✅ Should redirect to dashboard with auto-submit message\n";
echo "   7. ✅ Should NOT be able to continue exam\n";

echo "\n   **Test Multiple Violations:**\n";
echo "   1. Get first violation (tab switch, logout, return)\n";
echo "   2. ✅ Should see first warning banner\n";
echo "   3. Switch tabs again (second violation)\n";
echo "   4. ✅ Should see 'FINAL WARNING' banner\n";
echo "   5. Switch tabs third time\n";
echo "   6. ✅ Should see 'ACCOUNT LOCKED' message\n";

echo "\n7. Security Warning Messages:\n";
echo "\n   **First Violation Return:**\n";
echo "   '⚠️ SECURITY VIOLATION RECORDED: You were logged out for tab switching.\n";
echo "   You can continue where you left off, but your timer keeps running.\n";
echo "   WARNING: If you do this again, your account may be LOCKED!'\n";

echo "\n   **Second Violation Return:**\n";
echo "   '🚨 FINAL WARNING: This is your second tab switching violation!\n";
echo "   You can continue where you left off, but ONE MORE VIOLATION will\n";
echo "   LOCK your account for this subject!'\n";

echo "\n   **Third+ Violation Return:**\n";
echo "   '🔒 MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS: You have multiple security violations recorded.\n";
echo "   You can continue this exam, but your account may be locked for future exams.'\n";

echo "\n8. Technical Implementation:\n";
echo "\n   **Session Management:**\n";
echo "   - ExamSession remains active (is_active = true)\n";
echo "   - Only user authentication session is invalidated\n";
echo "   - Progress (answers, current_question_index) preserved\n";
echo "   - Timer calculation continues from original start time\n";

echo "\n   **Violation Recording:**\n";
echo "   - Each tab switch creates database record\n";
echo "   - Violation count tracked per user/subject\n";
echo "   - Recent violations checked on exam restart\n";
echo "   - Progressive warnings based on count\n";

echo "\n   **UI Feedback:**\n";
echo "   - Security warning banner with animations\n";
echo "   - Clear messaging about continuation\n";
echo "   - Closeable warning (doesn't affect exam)\n";
echo "   - Visual emphasis on consequences\n";

echo "\n9. Benefits of This Approach:\n";
echo "\n   🎯 **Student-Friendly:**\n";
echo "   • No lost progress from violations\n";
echo "   • Clear understanding of consequences\n";
echo "   • Fair treatment (timer keeps running)\n";
echo "   • Opportunity to complete exam\n";

echo "\n   🛡️ **Security Maintained:**\n";
echo "   • All violations still recorded\n";
echo "   • Progressive punishment system\n";
echo "   • Strong deterrent effect\n";
echo "   • Complete audit trail\n";

echo "\n   ⚖️ **Fair and Balanced:**\n";
echo "   • Students can recover from mistakes\n";
echo "   • Timer prevents abuse (no extra time)\n";
echo "   • Clear escalation path\n";
echo "   • Consistent enforcement\n";

echo "\n10. Edge Cases Handled:\n";
echo "\n   ✅ **Timer Expiration During Logout:**\n";
echo "   - Exam auto-submits if timer expires\n";
echo "   - Student cannot continue expired exam\n";
echo "   - Clear message about auto-submission\n";

echo "\n   ✅ **Multiple Rapid Violations:**\n";
echo "   - Each violation recorded separately\n";
echo "   - Count increases appropriately\n";
echo "   - Messages escalate correctly\n";

echo "\n   ✅ **Session Cleanup:**\n";
echo "   - Expired sessions handled properly\n";
echo "   - No orphaned data\n";
echo "   - Clean state management\n";

echo "\n11. Database Impact:\n";
echo "\n   **Violation Records:**\n";
echo "   - Each tab switch creates permanent record\n";
echo "   - Includes timestamp, IP, browser info\n";
echo "   - Linked to user, subject, and session\n";
echo "   - Available for reporting and analysis\n";

echo "\n   **Session State:**\n";
echo "   - ExamSession.is_active remains true\n";
echo "   - ExamSession.answers preserved\n";
echo "   - ExamSession.current_question_index preserved\n";
echo "   - ExamSession.last_activity_at updated\n";

echo "\n=== Test Complete ===\n";
echo "\nTab switch continuation is now implemented!\n";
echo "Students can continue where they left off after violations,\n";
echo "but their timer keeps running and violations are recorded.\n";
echo "This provides a fair balance between security and usability.\n";
