/**
 * Test Scoreboard Export Routes Fix
 * This script documents the fix for missing export routes
 */

echo "Scoreboard Export Routes Fix Summary\n";
echo "===================================\n\n";

echo "PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:\n";
echo "- Route [admin.scoreboard.export.csv] not defined\n";
echo "- Route [admin.scoreboard.export.excel] not defined\n";
echo "- JavaScript trying to access non-existent routes\n";
echo "- Export buttons not working\n\n";

echo "SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:\n";
echo "=====================\n\n";

echo "1. ADDED MISSING ROUTES:\n";
echo "   ✅ Route::get('scoreboard/export-csv', [AdminScoreboardController::class, 'exportCsv'])->name('scoreboard.export.csv')\n";
echo "   ✅ Route::get('scoreboard/export-excel', [AdminScoreboardController::class, 'exportExcel'])->name('scoreboard.export.excel')\n";
echo "   ✅ Kept existing Route::get('scoreboard/export/{format}', ...) for flexibility\n\n";

echo "2. ADDED CONTROLLER METHODS:\n";
echo "   ✅ exportCsv(Request \$request) - calls export(\$request, 'csv')\n";
echo "   ✅ exportExcel(Request \$request) - calls export(\$request, 'excel')\n";
echo "   ✅ Reuses existing export logic for consistency\n\n";

echo "3. FIXED JAVASCRIPT EXPORT FUNCTION:\n";
echo "   ✅ Uses specific route names for CSV and Excel\n";
echo "   ✅ Fallback to general export route for other formats\n";
echo "   ✅ Proper URL construction with class_id parameter\n";
echo "   ✅ Added console logging for debugging\n\n";

echo "AVAILABLE EXPORT ROUTES:\n";
echo "========================\n";
echo "• admin.scoreboard.export.csv - Direct CSV export\n";
echo "• admin.scoreboard.export.excel - Direct Excel export\n";
echo "• admin.scoreboard.export - General export with format parameter\n";
echo "• admin.scoreboard.custom-export - Custom export with options\n\n";

echo "EXPORT FUNCTIONALITY:\n";
echo "====================\n";
echo "✅ CSV Export - Generates clean CSV with only subjects that have scores\n";
echo "✅ Excel Export - Uses Excel headers (currently CSV format with .xls extension)\n";
echo "✅ Proper filename generation with class name and timestamp\n";
echo "✅ Data validation and error handling\n";
echo "✅ Ranking and position calculation\n";
echo "✅ Percentage calculations\n\n";

echo "EXPORT DATA INCLUDES:\n";
echo "====================\n";
echo "• Student Name\n";
echo "• Registration Number\n";
echo "• Class Name\n";
echo "• Subject Scores (only subjects with actual scores)\n";
echo "• Total Score\n";
echo "• Average Percentage\n";
echo "• Position/Rank\n\n";

echo "TESTING CHECKLIST:\n";
echo "==================\n";
echo "□ Select a class with student scores\n";
echo "□ Click 'Export CSV' button\n";
echo "□ Verify CSV file downloads with correct data\n";
echo "□ Click 'Export Excel' button\n";
echo "□ Verify Excel file downloads with correct data\n";
echo "□ Check filename includes class name and timestamp\n";
echo "□ Verify only subjects with scores are included\n";
echo "□ Check rankings are correct\n";
echo "□ Verify percentages are calculated properly\n";
echo "□ Test with different classes\n\n";

echo "ERROR HANDLING:\n";
echo "===============\n";
echo "✅ Class not found - redirects with error message\n";
echo "✅ No data available - redirects with error message\n";
echo "✅ Invalid format - redirects with error message\n";
echo "✅ Missing class_id - JavaScript alert\n\n";

echo "BROWSER CONSOLE MESSAGES:\n";
echo "=========================\n";
echo "Look for: 'Exporting to: [URL]' when export buttons are clicked\n\n";

echo "✅ SCOREBOARD EXPORT FIX COMPLETE!\n";
echo "The export functionality should now work properly.\n";
