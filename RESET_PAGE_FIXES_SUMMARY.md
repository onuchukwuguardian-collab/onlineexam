# Reset Page Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. JavaScript Error: `selectResetType is not defined`
**Problem**: The JavaScript function `selectResetType` was missing from the reset page, causing onclick errors.

**Solution**: 
- Completely rewrote the reset page with proper JavaScript functions
- Added `selectResetType(type)` function to handle reset type selection
- Added `goBackToSelection()` function for navigation
- Added proper event handlers for form interactions

### 2. Admin Sidebar Icons
**Problem**: Admin sidebar had basic, generic icons that weren't visually appealing.

**Solution**: Updated all admin navigation icons to more descriptive and professional ones:
- **Students & Users**: `fas fa-user-graduate` (graduation cap icon)
- **Classes**: `fas fa-chalkboard-teacher` (teacher at chalkboard icon)  
- **Subjects & Questions**: `fas fa-book-open` (open book icon)
- **Scoreboard**: `fas fa-trophy` (trophy icon)
- **Exam Reset**: `fas fa-redo-alt` (reset/redo icon)
- **System Management**: `fas fa-server` (server icon)

### 3. Reset Page Layout and Design
**Problem**: The reset page layout was "awful and ugly" with poor styling.

**Solution**: Complete redesign with modern, professional styling:
- **Modern Card Design**: Used Bootstrap 5 cards with gradients and shadows
- **Professional Color Scheme**: Blue for individual reset, orange/yellow for bulk reset
- **Better Typography**: Improved fonts, spacing, and hierarchy
- **Icon Integration**: Added contextual icons throughout the interface
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout with proper grid system
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and smooth transitions
