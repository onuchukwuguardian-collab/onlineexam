```

### **2. Enhanced Student Data**

return (object) [
    'id' => $student->id,

    'scores_data' => $studentScoresData,
    'total_score' => $totalScore,
    'total_possible_score' => $totalPossibleScoreAcrossTakenSubjects,
    'average_percentage' => $averagePercentage,
    'subjects_taken_count' => $subjectsTakenCount,
    'subjects_available_count' => $classSubjects->count(),
];
```
