# Exam Page Refresh and Copy Protection Fix

## Issues Addressed

### 1. 🔄 **Page Refresh Problem**
**Problem**: When students refresh the exam page, the exam would restart from the beginning, losing all progress and resetting the timer.

**Impact**: 
- Students lose all their answers
- Timer resets to full duration
- Causes frustration and unfair disadvantage
- Students have to start over completely

### 2. 🔒 **Copy/Paste Security Gap**
**Problem**: Students could copy question content and paste external answers, compromising exam integrity.

**Impact**:
- Academic dishonesty opportunities
- Questions could be shared with other students
- External answers could be pasted in
- Unfair advantage for some students

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ **Page Refresh State Restoration**

**How it works:**
1. **Server-Side Storage**: Exam progress is continuously saved to the database
   - Current question position (`current_question_index`)
   - All student answers (`answers` JSON field)
   - Timer state (calculated from start time)

2. **Client-Side Restoration**: On page load, JavaScript restores the saved state
   - Loads saved answers from server
   - Restores radio button selections
   - Navigates to the last question position
   - Timer continues from correct remaining time

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// Restore saved position and answers
let currentQuestion = {{ $examSession->current_question_index ?? 0 }};
const savedAnswers = @json($examSession->answers ?? []);

// Restore progress on page load
restoreSavedProgress();
```

### ✅ **Comprehensive Copy/Paste Protection**

**Protection Features:**
1. **Right-Click Disabled**: Context menu blocked with security warning
2. **Text Selection Blocked**: Cannot select question text (except input fields)
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts Disabled**:
   - `Ctrl+C` (Copy)
   - `Ctrl+V` (Paste) 
   - `Ctrl+X` (Cut)
   - `Ctrl+A` (Select All)
   - `Ctrl+S` (Save)
   - `Ctrl+P` (Print)
   - `F12` (Developer Tools)
   - `Ctrl+U` (View Source)
   - `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Developer Tools)

4. **CSS Protection**: Text selection disabled via CSS
5. **Drag & Drop Disabled**: Prevents dragging content
6. **Visual Warnings**: Security alerts inform students of restrictions

## Technical Implementation

### State Restoration Process

```javascript
function restoreSavedProgress() {
    // Restore answers from server
    if (savedAnswers && typeof savedAnswers === 'object') {
        Object.keys(savedAnswers).forEach(questionId => {
            const selectedOption = savedAnswers[questionId];
            const radio = document.querySelector(`input[data-question-id=\"${questionId}\"][value=\"${selectedOption}\"]`);
            if (radio) {
                radio.checked = true;
                // Update answered questions tracking
                const questionIndex = findQuestionIndexById(questionId);
                if (questionIndex !== -1) {
                    answeredQuestions[questionIndex] = true;
                }
            }
        });
    }
    
    // Navigate to saved question position
    if (currentQuestion > 0 && currentQuestion < totalQuestions) {
        goToQuestion(currentQuestion);
    }
}
```

### Copy Protection System

```javascript
function enableCopyPasteProtection() {
    // Disable right-click
    document.addEventListener('contextmenu', function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        showSecurityWarning('Right-click is disabled during the exam');
        return false;
    });
    
    // Disable text selection
    document.addEventListener('selectstart', function(e) {
        if (e.target.tagName === 'INPUT' || e.target.tagName === 'TEXTAREA') {
            return true; // Allow in input fields
        }
        e.preventDefault();
        return false;
    });
    
    // Disable keyboard shortcuts
    document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
        if (e.ctrlKey && (e.key === 'c' || e.key === 'v' || e.key === 'x' || e.key === 'a' || e.key === 's' || e.key === 'p')) {
            e.preventDefault();
            showSecurityWarning('Copy/paste operations are disabled during the exam');
            return false;
        }
        // ... more key combinations
    });
}
```
