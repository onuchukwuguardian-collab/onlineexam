echo "\n2. Expected Behavior:\n";
echo "   ✓ Page loads without auto-advancing questions\n";
echo "   ✓ Auto-advance only triggers after user clicks an answer\n";
echo "   ✓ 500ms delay before auto-advance becomes active\n";
echo "   ✓ Console shows 'Initialization complete' message\n";

echo "\n3. Testing Instructions:\n";
echo "   To test the fix:\n";
echo "   1. Start an exam as a student\n";
echo "   2. Observe that the page loads on question 1\n";
echo "   3. Verify it doesn't immediately jump to question 2\n";
echo "   4. Click an answer - should auto-advance after 1 second\n";
echo "   5. Check browser console for initialization message\n";

echo "\n4. Root Cause Fixed:\n";
echo "   - Auto-advance was triggering during page initialization\n";
echo "   - System was treating answer restoration as user interaction\n";
echo "   - Added initialization flag to prevent premature auto-advance\n";
echo "   - Flag is cleared after 500ms to allow normal operation\n";

echo "\n5. Files Modified:\n";
echo "   - resources/views/user/exam_simple.blade.php\n";
echo "     * Added isInitializing flag\n";
echo "     * Modified handleAutoAdvance to check flag\n";
echo "     * Added timeout to reset flag after initialization\n";

echo "\n=== Test Complete ===\n";
