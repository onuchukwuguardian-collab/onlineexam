# ✅ SUBJECT NAME FIX VERIFICATION

## 🎯 **PROBLEM SOLVED**

**Issue:** Subject name was showing as "Unknown Subject" in violation-detected page

**Root Cause:** 
- SecurityViewController only looked for active ban records
- When no ban exists or ban doesn't have subject relationship loaded, subject name was unknown
- No fallback mechanism to get subject information

## 🔧 **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Enhanced SecurityViewController**
- ✅ Added support for `subject_id` URL parameter
- ✅ Improved ban query to include subject relationship (`->with('subject')`)
- ✅ Added fallback to check recent violations if no ban found
- ✅ Pass both `$ban` and `$subject` to the view

### **2. Updated Blade Template**
- ✅ Enhanced subject name display logic:
  ```blade
  @if($ban && $ban->subject)
      {{ $ban->subject->name }}
  @elseif(isset($subject) && $subject)
      {{ $subject->name }}
  @else
      Unknown Subject
  @endif
  ```
- ✅ Fixed form `subject_id` to use fallback values

### **3. Updated JavaScript Redirects**
- ✅ All redirects to `/security/critical-warning` now include `?subject_id=X`
- ✅ Critical warning page passes subject_id to violation-detected page
- ✅ exam-security.js gets subject_id from state or URL parameters

## 📋 **FILES MODIFIED**

1. **SecurityViewController.php**
   - Enhanced `violationDetected()` method
   - Added subject_id parameter support
   - Improved ban query with relationships

2. **violation-detected.blade.php**
   - Enhanced subject name display logic
   - Fixed form subject_id handling

3. **critical-warning.blade.php**
   - Added subject_id parameter to reactivation link

4. **exam_simple.blade.php**
   - Updated all JavaScript redirects to include subject_id

5. **exam-security.js**
   - Enhanced acknowledge button redirect with subject_id

## 🎯 **EXPECTED RESULT**

**Before:**
```
Subject: Unknown Subject
```

**After:**
```
Subject: Mathematics (or actual subject name)
```
