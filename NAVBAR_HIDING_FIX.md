# Navbar Hiding During Exam Fix

## Problem Description

Students were seeing the navigation bar during exams, which could be distracting and potentially allow them to navigate away from the exam or access other parts of the system during the test.

## Solution Implemented

Added CSS styles to hide the navbar completely during exam sessions, creating a distraction-free, full-screen exam environment.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. `resources/views/user/exam.blade.php`
2. `resources/views/user/exam_simple.blade.php` 
3. `resources/views/user/exam_enhanced.blade.php`

### CSS Added to Each File:
```css
/* Hide navbar during exam */
.navbar {
    display: none !important;
}

/* Adjust main wrapper to remove top margin since navbar is hidden */
.main-wrapper {
    margin-top: 0 !important;
}
```
