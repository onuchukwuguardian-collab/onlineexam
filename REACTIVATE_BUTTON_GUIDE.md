## ✅ CONFIRMED: User-Based Ban System

### 🎯 How the Ban System Works:

1. **User-Based Tracking** ✅
   - Bans are linked to **Student Registration Number**
   - Bans are linked to **Student Email Address**  
   - Bans are linked to **Student Password/Credentials**
   - **NOT linked to IP Address**

2. **IP Address Usage** 📝
   - IP addresses are **logged for audit only**
   - IP addresses are **NOT used for ban identification**
   - This prevents unfair penalties in shared computer labs

3. **3-Strike System** ⚠️
   - 1st Tab Switch: Warning + Logout
   - 2nd Tab Switch: Final Warning + Logout  
   - 3rd Tab Switch: **PERMANENT BAN**

### 🏫 Benefits for School Environment:

- **Computer Labs**: Multiple students can use same computer
- **Shared Devices**: Only the violating student gets banned
- **Fair System**: Each student tracked individually
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging for security reviews

### 🔧 Reactivation Features:

- **Admin-Only**: Only administrators can reactivate
- **Reason Required**: Must provide justification
- **Audit Logging**: All reactivations are logged
- **Immediate Effect**: Student can retake exam immediately

## 🚨 Important Notes:

1. **Reactivate buttons are RED** - Easy to spot
2. **User identification**: Registration number, email, password
3. **IP logging**: For audit trail only, not ban decisions
4. **Clean slate**: Reactivated students get fresh violation count
