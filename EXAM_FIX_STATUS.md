# Exam Page Fix Status Report

## ‚úÖ FIXES APPLIED

### 1. Font CSP Issue - FIXED
**Problem**: Fonts being blocked by Content Security Policy
**Solution**: Added `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com` and `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net` to font-src in SecurityHeaders.php
**Status**: ‚úÖ Should resolve font loading errors

### 2. NextQuestion Function Logic - FIXED  
**Problem**: Function looking for `.question-container` but HTML uses `.question-block`
**Solution**: Updated JavaScript to:
- Look for `.question-block[style*="block"]` (visible question)
- Use `getElementById` with proper question IDs
- Use `style.display` instead of CSS classes for show/hide
**Status**: ‚úÖ Should resolve "No current question found" error

### 3. Vite IPv4 Configuration - ALREADY FIXED
**Problem**: IPv6 CSP violations from `[::1]:5173`
**Solution**: Configured Vite to use IPv4 `127.0.0.1` and updated CSP
**Status**: ‚úÖ Vite running on 127.0.0.1:5174

## üîç REMAINING ISSUE

### JavaScript Syntax Error at Line 6517
**Problem**: `Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '}'`
**Status**: üîß Still investigating - likely unmatched braces in large JavaScript section

## üìã TESTING CHECKLIST

### Immediate Tests (You Can Do Now):
1. **Refresh your exam page** - Font errors should be gone
2. **Click "Next" button** - Should work and show "Successfully moved to next question" in console  
3. **Check browser console** - Should see proper logging instead of "No current question found"

### Expected Console Output (Good):
```
nextQuestion function called
Moving from question 1 to 2  
Successfully moved to next question
```

### If Still Broken:
- The syntax error at line 6517 may still cause issues
- The nextQuestion function should work better now
- May need to clean up the large JavaScript sections

## üéØ NEXT STEPS

If the nextQuestion button still doesn't work:
1. Share the new console output
2. I'll locate and fix the remaining syntax error
3. May need to extract JavaScript to separate files for better maintainability

The main improvements should be visible immediately with just a page refresh!
