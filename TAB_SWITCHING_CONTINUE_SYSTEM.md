## 🎓 **STUDENT EXPERIENCE**

### **Normal Exam Flow**
1. Student takes exam normally
2. All exam functions work as expected
3. No interference with regular exam activities

### **After 1st Violation**
1. Student accidentally tries to switch tabs (Ctrl+T, Alt+Tab, etc.)
2. **Action is blocked immediately**
3. **Warning modal appears** with continue button
4. Student clicks **"✅ CONTINUE EXAM"**
5. **Modal disappears** and student continues exam normally
6. **No logout, no interruption** - just a warning

### **After 2nd Violation**
1. Student tries to switch tabs again
2. **Action is blocked immediately**
3. **Final warning modal appears** with continue button
4. Student clicks **"✅ CONTINUE EXAM"**
5. **Modal disappears** and student continues exam normally
6. **Clear warning**: "One more attempt will permanently block you"

### **After 3rd Violation**
1. Student tries to switch tabs third time
2. **Action is blocked immediately**
3. **Permanent block modal appears** with **NO continue button**
4. **Automatic logout** after 5 seconds
5. **Exam auto-submitted** with current answers
6. **Cannot access exam again** - only admin can reactivate

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Continue Warning Function**
```javascript
function showContinueWarning(message, isPermanent = false) {
    // Creates modal with green "CONTINUE EXAM" button
    // Student can click to dismiss and continue exam
    // No logout, no interruption
}
```

### **Permanent Block Function**
```javascript
function showPermanentBlockWarning(message) {
    // Creates red pulsing modal with NO continue button
    // Auto-redirects to login after 5 seconds
    // Triggers exam auto-submission and ban
}
```

### **Progressive Logic**
```javascript
if (tabSwitchCount >= 3) {
    // 3rd attempt: PERMANENT BLOCK (no continue)
    showPermanentBlockWarning('PERMANENTLY BLOCKED...');
    recordSecurityViolation(...); // Triggers ban
} else {
    // 1st/2nd attempt: WARNING + CONTINUE BUTTON
    showContinueWarning('Tab switching blocked...', false);
}
```

## 🛡️ **WHAT GETS BLOCKED**

All attempts are still **completely blocked**, but handling differs:

### **Always Blocked**
- ❌ `Ctrl+T` (new tab)
- ❌ `Alt+Tab` (switch applications)
- ❌ `Ctrl+Tab` (switch browser tabs)
- ❌ `Ctrl+Shift+T` (reopen tab)
- ❌ Middle-click (new tab)
- ❌ Right-click context menu
- ❌ `window.open()` JavaScript calls

### **Different Responses**
- **1st & 2nd Attempts**: Warning + Continue Button
- **3rd Attempt**: Permanent Block + No Continue Button

## 👨‍💼 **ADMIN FEATURES**

### **Violation Tracking**
- All 3 attempts are logged in database
- Administrators can see progression: 1st → 2nd → 3rd
- Complete audit trail maintained

### **Reactivation Required**
- After 3rd attempt, **only admin can reactivate**
- Student cannot access exam until reactivated
- Admin dashboard shows banned students
- Reactivation button available at `/admin/security/banned-students`

## 📊 **DATABASE RECORDS**

### **1st & 2nd Attempts**
