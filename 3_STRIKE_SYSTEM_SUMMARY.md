# 3-Strike Tab Switching Detection System - FULLY IMPLEMENTED ‚úÖ

## Overview
The system is **FULLY OPERATIONAL** and enforces a strict 3-strike policy for students who open new browser tabs during exams.

## How the 3-Strike System Works

### Strike 1: Warning + Logout
- **Detection**: Student switches tabs/windows during exam
- **Action**: Immediate logout with progress saved
- **Message**: "‚ö†Ô∏è FIRST VIOLATION: Tab switching detected! You have been logged out but can continue where you left off. Your timer keeps running. WARNING: 2 more violations will result in PERMANENT BAN!"
- **Database**: Violation recorded in `exam_security_violations` table
- **Logging**: Info level log for admin monitoring

### Strike 2: Final Warning + Logout  
- **Detection**: Second tab switching violation
- **Action**: Immediate logout with progress saved
- **Message**: "üö® SECOND VIOLATION: You can continue this exam, but ONE MORE TAB SWITCH will AUTO-SUBMIT your exam and PERMANENTLY BAN you from this subject!"
- **Database**: Second violation recorded
- **Logging**: Warning level log for admin monitoring

### Strike 3: AUTO-SUBMIT + PERMANENT BAN
- **Detection**: Third tab switching violation
- **Action**: 
  - Exam automatically submitted with current answers
  - Student permanently banned from retaking that subject
  - Score calculated and saved
  - Session terminated
- **Message**: "üîí THIRD VIOLATION: Your exam has been AUTO-SUBMITTED and you are PERMANENTLY BANNED from this subject. You cannot retake this exam."
- **Database**: 
  - Violation recorded in `exam_security_violations`
  - Ban record created in `exam_bans` table
  - Score saved in `user_scores` table
- **Logging**: Critical level log for admin dashboard

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Detection (JavaScript)
- **Tab Switching**: `document.addEventListener('visibilitychange')`
- **Window Switching**: `window.addEventListener('blur')`
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Pre-emptive warnings for Alt+Tab, Ctrl+Tab
- **Progress Saving**: Automatic save before violation recording

### Backend Processing (PHP)
- **Route**: `POST /student/exam/security-violation`
- **Controller**: `ExamController@recordSecurityViolation`
- **Validation**: Session ownership, request validation
- **Progressive Logic**: 1st/2nd warning, 3rd auto-submit + ban

### Database Tables
1. **`exam_security_violations`**: Records all violations with metadata
2. **`exam_bans`**: Tracks permanently banned students
3. **`exam_sessions`**: Manages active exam sessions
4. **`user_scores`**: Stores final exam scores
5. **`user_answers`**: Records student responses

## Admin Dashboard Integration

### Detailed Logging
All violations are logged with comprehensive details:
- Student identity (ID, name, email)
- Exam context (subject, session)
- Technical metadata (IP, browser, timestamp)
- Violation count and progression
- Ban status and reasoning

### Log Levels
- **INFO**: Normal exam activities, first violations
- **WARNING**: Second violations, concerning patterns
- **CRITICAL**: Third violations, permanent bans, system alerts

### Sample Critical Log Entry
```json
{
    "level": "CRITICAL",
    "message": "STUDENT BANNED: User 123 (John Doe) permanently banned from subject 45 after 3 security violations",
    "context": {
        "user_id": 123,
        "user_name": "John Doe", 
        "user_email": "john@example.com",
        "subject_id": 45,
        "total_violations": 3,
        "ban_id": 78,
        "exam_session_id": 456,
        "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
        "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
        "violation_details": [...]
    }
}
```

## Security Features

### What Gets Detected
‚úÖ **Tab Switching**: Opening new tabs, clicking other tabs  
‚úÖ **Window Switching**: Alt+Tab to other applications  
‚úÖ **Browser Focus Loss**: Clicking outside browser window  
‚úÖ **Navigation Attempts**: Trying to leave exam page

### What Gets Recorded
üìä **Complete Forensic Data**:
- Exact timestamps
- IP addresses and user agents
- Screen resolution and window size
- Browser information
- Violation progression history

### Progressive Enforcement
1. **Deterrent Warnings**: Clear consequences communicated upfront
2. **Immediate Response**: No delay between violation and action
3. **Escalating Consequences**: Each violation has increasing severity
4. **Permanent Record**: All violations stored for audit trail

## Testing the System

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Start an exam** as a student
2. **Answer 2-3 questions** normally
3. **Switch to new tab** (Ctrl+T or click existing tab)
4. **Verify**: Immediate logout with warning message
5. **Log back in** and continue exam
6. **Repeat 2 more times** to test full progression

### Expected Behavior
- ‚úÖ **Instant Detection**: No delay in violation detection
- ‚úÖ **Progress Preservation**: Answers saved before logout
- ‚úÖ **Clear Messages**: Progressive warning system
- ‚úÖ **Database Records**: All violations permanently logged
- ‚úÖ **Final Ban**: Third violation prevents future attempts

## File Locations

### Key Files
