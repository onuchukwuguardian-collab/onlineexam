# 🚫 TAB SWITCHING 3-STRIKE SYSTEM - FULLY OPERATIONAL ✅

## 🎯 **SYSTEM OVERVIEW**

Your tab-switching detection and blocking system is **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** and **READY FOR USE**. The system prevents students from cheating by opening new browser tabs during exams and implements a fair 3-strike policy with permanent bans.

## ⚡ **HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS**

### **Real-Time Detection & Blocking**
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Blocks `Ctrl+T`, `Alt+Tab`, `Ctrl+Tab`, `Ctrl+Shift+T`
- **Mouse Actions**: Blocks middle-click and right-click context menus
- **JavaScript Attempts**: Blocks `window.open()` calls
- **Tab Switching**: Detects when students switch away from exam tab

### **3-Strike Progressive Policy**

#### **🥇 1st Violation**
```
⚠️ TAB SWITCHING BLOCKED! 
Attempt #1/3. You have 2 attempts remaining.

[✅ CONTINUE EXAM] ← Student can continue
```
- Student gets warning but can continue exam
- Violation recorded in database
- Timer keeps running (no pause)

#### **🥈 2nd Violation**
```
🚨 FINAL WARNING: Tab switching attempt #2/3. 
ONE MORE ATTEMPT will permanently BLOCK you from this exam!

[✅ CONTINUE EXAM] ← Student can still continue
```
- Final warning with continue button
- Clear warning about consequences
- Timer continues running

#### **🥉 3rd Violation - PERMANENT BAN**
```
🚫 PERMANENTLY BLOCKED 🚫

Too many tab switching attempts! 
You are now PERMANENTLY BLOCKED from this exam. 
Only an administrator can reactivate your account.

[NO CONTINUE BUTTON] ← Student is blocked
```
